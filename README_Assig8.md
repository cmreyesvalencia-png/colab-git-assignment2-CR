# Parkinson's Disease Classification

## Project Description
This machine learning project predicts Parkinson's disease diagnosis using clinical and demographic data. The analysis compares K-Nearest Neighbors vs Logistic Regression models, with Logistic Regression achieving **80% accuracy** and **84.2% F1-score**. The project includes comprehensive EDA, model evaluation, and prediction capabilities.

## Quick Setup & Run (Google Colab)

### Step 1: Open Google Colab
1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Sign in with your Google account

### Step 2: Upload and Open Notebook
1. Download `Lesson_8_assignment.ipynb` to your computer
2. In Colab, click **File → Upload notebook**
3. Select the downloaded `.ipynb` file
4. Click **Open**

### Step 3: Run the Analysis
1. Click **Runtime → Run all** (or press `Ctrl+F9`)
2. Wait for all cells to execute automatically
3. The notebook will:
   - Load dataset from GitHub
   - Perform data cleaning and EDA
   - Train both ML models
   - Generate performance metrics and charts
   - Save the best model as `.pkl` files

## Dataset Source
- **Location**: GitHub repository
- **Automatically loaded** from:
